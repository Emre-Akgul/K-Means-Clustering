# KMeans Clustering Implementation in Scala
## Introduction
This project implements the KMeans clustering algorithm in Scala, showcasing an efficient approach to partition a set of points in three-dimensional space into clusters. This algorithm is crucial for data analysis, pattern recognition, and image processing. It demonstrates the power of parallel collections in Scala for improving performance.

## Features
Parallel Collections: Utilizes Scala's parallel collections for efficient data processing, enabling faster computation by taking advantage of multicore processors.

Custom Point Class: Defines a Point class to represent points in three-dimensional space, providing functionalities to calculate distances between points.

Modular Interface: Implements a trait KMeansInterface to define the core functionalities of the KMeans algorithm, ensuring a clear and modular structure.

Efficient Clustering: Includes methods for classifying points into clusters based on their proximity to the centroids, updating centroids based on classified points, and checking for convergence.

Performance Measurement: Incorporates performance measurement using ScalaMeter, allowing for benchmarking of sequential vs. parallel execution times, showcasing the speedup achieved through parallelism.
Utility Functions: Provides utility functions for generating random points and initializing means, facilitating the testing and demonstration of the algorithm.
